# Getting Started with SSI development on the Hyperledger Stack
## A tutorial series using the aries-basic-controller library with ACA-Py

With docker installed, run the example using ./manage start

This spins up an aries agent and a notebook for both Alice and Bob. Additionally a local von-network is initialised.

To access the tutorials in the jupyter notebook run from the **root PyDentity folder**:

`./scripts/get_URLS.sh`

This will print out the urls with tokens for all jupyter notebook instances running within docker.

Navigate to the links and begin the tutorial starting from Part 1.
