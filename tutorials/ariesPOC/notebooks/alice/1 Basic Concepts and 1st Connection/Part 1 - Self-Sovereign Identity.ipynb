    "This notebook aims to give a brief introduction to SSI and why we think it is important. For those new to these concepts further material will be linked throughout the tutorial.\n",

    "## What is SSI?\n",
    "\n",
    "SSI is term used to loosely describe an emerging set of standards and technologies focused on enabling identification, authentication and authorisation between peers without requiring a trusted third party (Identity Provider) to mediate the interaction. As this often compromises privacy (think Facebook Connect).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two key specifications in this space are:\n",
    "* [Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) - Self-authenticating identifiers that must be resolvable to a DID Document containing a set of cryptographic keys and communication endpoints. Have a look at the following lecture to get a better idea!:\n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcfy9wd5bZI  \n",
    "* [Verifiable Credential Data Model](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/) - A data model for a set of Verifiable Claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although many others are emerging in forums such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/)\n",
    "* [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/)\n",

    "* [Security Without Identification](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/pub/secsem/chaum1985bigbrother.pdf) - A 1985 paper by David Chaum that outlines the need to privacy-preserving mechanisms for identification and authentication that is remarkably consistent with what we call SSI today."

    "\n",
    "You might be thinking what has this got to do with OpenMined and privacy-preserving machine learning ...\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe there are a lot of synergies that are worth exploring between PPML and SSI. Primarily how can SSI enable identification, authentication and authorisation of the communication channels between participants in PPML flows. In particular we are interested in the use of the [DIDComm protocol](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging) as a mechanism to connect peers within a PPML workflow and enable them to both request and present attributes about themselves in order to establish the appropriate level of trust before initiating the PPML messaging flows, potentially across the same DIDComm channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, SSI is a key driver for getting data out of silos and into the hands of entities able to contribute it to PPML."

    "* [indy-plenum](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum) - the consensus algorithm used by the ledger.\n",

    "[Hyperledger Ursa](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa) is the core cryptography library for all Hyperledger projects. It is written in Rust and specific to SSI it includes the anonymous credential cryptography code for CL-RSA signatures.

    "Hyperledger Aries deals with the application layer of the SSI stack. It is a set of specifications that define how to develop agents capable of leveraging the cryptography in Ursa and communicating with Indy ledgers enabling them to connect with peers, issue credentials, present proofs and verify proofs.\n",
